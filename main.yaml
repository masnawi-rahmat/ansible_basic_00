# ansible_basic_00
# this playbook is created by masnawi rahmat
# in Generation SG/Temasek Poly SGUPMSCT Cloud Support and DevOps Bootcamp cohort no 4 Yr 2022
# this playbook is created with learning purpose more than optimisation in mind
# this playbook creates an 'imaginary' company (company_x) and its departments as directory and subdirectories with department heads named in respective txt files
# objective of this playbook is to give you the basic understanding of how ansible works using 'file', 'copy' and 'loop' functions to:
# (1) create directory and subdirectories
# (2) create txt files with contents in the subdirectories
# please substitute 'your_user_name' with your own user name
# go ahead and change the the directory/subdirectries name and contents of the txt files; and run and re-run the playbook and see what happen
